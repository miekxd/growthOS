The brain relies on sleep to consolidate memories, process information, and maintain optimal cognitive performance. During sleep, neural pathways are strengthened, important memories are transferred from short-term to long-term storage, and unnecessary information is filtered out. Sleep deprivation severely impairs attention, decision-making, problem-solving abilities, and reaction times. Students who get sufficient sleep perform better academically, while workers show improved creativity, focus, and productivity. The brain's ability to form new neural connections and adapt to learning depends heavily on consistent, quality sleep cycles.
